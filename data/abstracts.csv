"Comparative studies of variation in the ecology and genetics of natural plant popu-
lations located at the limits and in the center of a species range provide fundamental insights into the historical
formation of species distribution patterns.
In this study, we quantify variation in the ecological niche and the expression of a ﬂoral
polymorphism across the range of the Mediterranean geophyte Narcissus dubius Gouan. An exhaustive data
set of known locations was compiled to distinguish groups of geographically central and peripheral popula-
tions in both Spain and France. These occur across a double climatic gradient. First, there is a gradient from a
hot and dry Mediterranean climatic regime in eastern Spain to a milder Mediterranean climatic regime in south-
ern France (lower maximum temperature and shorter summer drought). Second, there is a shift to a more con-
tinental climate in peripheral populations in inland Spain. We also modeled the current climatic niche and pro-
duced historical projections of potential glacial refugia for this species.
Pivotal results. Peripheral populations showed consistent patterns of ecological niche differences with a
less rupicolous ecology, more bare soil, and a higher cover of annual species. The ecological niche was more
variable among peripheral populations than among central populations. Peripheral populations showed a re-
peated pattern of loss of stigma-height polymorphism and ﬂoral traits indicative of a reproductive strategy
based on within-morph mating (probably selﬁng to assure seed set). Climate models indicate that contempo-
rary peripheral populations (particularly in Spain) occur in areas that were least likely to have served as glacial
refugia.
Historical isolation and recolonization may have shaped contemporary patterns of ecological
niche and reproductive trait variation among central and peripheral populations.

"The ‘centre–periphery hypothesis’ (CPH) is a long-standing postulate in ecology that states that genetic variation
and demographic performance of a species decrease from the centre to the edge of its geographic range. This
hypothesis is based on an assumed concordance between geographical peripherality and ecological marginality such
that environmental conditions become harsher towards the limits of a species range. In this way, the CPH sets the
stage for understanding the causes of distribution limits. To date, no study has examined conjointly the consistency of
these postulates. In an extensive literature review we discuss the birth and development of the CPH and provide an
assessment of the CPH by reviewing 248 empirical studies in the context of three main themes. First, a decrease in
species occurrence towards their range limits was observed in 81% of studies, while only 51% demonstrated reduced
abundance of individuals. A decline in genetic variation, increased differentiation among populations and higher rates
of inbreeding were demonstrated by roughly one in two studies (47, 45 and 48%, respectively). However, demographic
rates, size and population performance less often followed CPH expectations (20–30% of studies). We highlight the
impact of important methodological, taxonomic, and biogeographical biases on such validation rates. Second, we
found that geographic and ecological marginality gradients are not systematically concordant, which casts doubt
on the reliability of a main assumption of the CPH. Finally, we attempt to disentangle the relative contribution of
geographical, ecological and historical processes on the spatial distribution of genetic and demographic parameters.
While ecological marginality gradients explain variation in species’ demographic performance better than geographic
gradients, contemporary and historical factors may contribute interactively to spatial patterns of genetic variation. We
thereby propose a framework that integrates species’ ecological niche characteristics together with current and past
range structure to investigate spatial patterns of genetic and demographic variation across species ranges.

"In this paper, we propose an integrative framework to assess the conservation status of rare plant popula-
tions that combines population trends with four criteria to assess habitat vulnerability. We illustrate how
population trends can be studied using a presence/absence method for a species that is inappropriate for
a demographic study. The four other criteria concern habitat fragmentation, the human footprint in the
surrounding landscape, observed impacts on a population and elements of habitat structure and quality
that may impinge on population status. Each criterion is assessed with various indicators that can be
adapted to the biology and ecology of the studied species. To test the feasibility of the proposed frame-
work, we perform a case study of a Mediterranean geophyte Allium chamaemoly L., a species listed for
protection in France. The results show a wide range of conservation status among a regional set of popu-
lations in the study species. Variation among the indicators used to assess different criteria illustrates the
importance of assessing a range of different factors and ways to combine them if population conservation
status is to be objectively identiﬁed. The study of diverse criteria may allow for a more precise assessment
of the causes of differences in conservation status among populations of a single species. The framework
of ﬁve criteria could be adapted by modiﬁcation or substitution of indicators or adaptation of thresholds
among classes, and thus be applied to other species of conservation importance. Conservation priorities

"Hybridisation plays a prominent role in plant evolution due to its influence on genetic diversity, fitness and adaptive potential. We identify a case of on-going hybrid evolu-
tion of floral phenotypes in disjunct populations of Cyclamen balearicum and
C. repandum subsp. repandum on Corsica and Sardinia.
Hybrid populations on the two islands contain similar patterns of variation in flower
colour and size but are probably at different stages in the evolutionary process of
hybridisation, and differences in the frequency of floral types and flower size suggest
hybrid vigour that may contribute to the dynamics and maintenance of hybrid forms.
In a review of cases of hybridisation in Mediterranean plants we found an equivalent
number of cases for the contemporary occurrence of mixed hybrid populations, as
there are cases of homoploid hybrid species differentiation.
We argue for the development of a conservation strategy for Mediterranean plants that
integrates the need to protect not just pure endemic species (some of hybrid origin)
but also mixed populations where adaptive variation and new species are evolving due
to contemporary hybridisation. conservation; Cyclamen endemism;
